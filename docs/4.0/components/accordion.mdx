## Examples

Click the accordions below to expand/collapse the accordion content.

export const AccordionExample = () => {
  const [activeKey, setActiveKey] = useState(0)
  return (
    <CAccordion>
      <CAccordionItem>
        <CAccordionHeader>
          <CAccordionButton collapsed={activeKey !== 1} onClick={() => activeKey === 1 ? setActiveKey(0) : setActiveKey(1)}>
            Accordion Item #1
          </CAccordionButton>
        </CAccordionHeader>
        <CAccordionCollapse visible={activeKey === 1}>
          <CAccordionBody>
            <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default,
            until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
            element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and
            hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding
            our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within
            the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
          </CAccordionBody>
        </CAccordionCollapse>
      </CAccordionItem>
      <CAccordionItem>
        <CAccordionHeader>

            Accordion Item #2
          </CAccordionButton>
        </CAccordionHeader>
        <CAccordionCollapse visible={activeKey === 2}>
          <CAccordionBody>
            <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default,
            until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
            element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and

      </CAccordionItem>
      <CAccordionItem>
        <CAccordionHeader>
          <CAccordionButton collapsed={activeKey !== 3} onClick={() => activeKey === 3 ? setActiveKey(0) : setActiveKey(3)}>
            Accordion Item #3
          </CAccordionButton>
        </CAccordionHeader>
        <CAccordionCollapse visible={activeKey === 3}>
          <CAccordionBody>
            <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default,
            until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
            element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and

### Flush

Add `flush` to remove the default `background-color`, some borders, and some rounded corners to render accordions edge-to-edge with their parent container.

<Example>
  <AccordionFlushExample />
</Example>

export const AccordionFlushExample = () => {
  const [activeKey, setActiveKey] = useState(0)
  return (
    <CAccordion flush>
      <CAccordionItem>

          <CAccordionButton collapsed={activeKey !== 1} onClick={() => activeKey === 1 ? setActiveKey(0) : setActiveKey(1)}>
            Accordion Item #1
          </CAccordionButton>
        </CAccordionHeader>
        <CAccordionCollapse visible={activeKey === 1}>
