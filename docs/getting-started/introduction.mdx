## Installation

### Npm

```bash
npm install @coreui/react@next
```

### Yarn

yarn add @coreui/react@next
```

## Using components

```jsx

import { Alert } from '@coreui/react';

```

## Stylesheets

React components are styled using `@coreui/coreui` CSS library, but you can use them also with bootstrap CSS library. That is possible because `@coreui/coreui` library is compatible with bootstrap, it just extends its functionalities. The only exception is custom CoreUI components, which don't exist in the Bootstrap ecosystem.
