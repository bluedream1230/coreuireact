## Examples

Click the accordions below to expand/collapse the accordion content.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [activeKey, setActiveKey] = useState(0)
    return (
      <CAccordion>
        <CAccordionItem>
          <CAccordionHeader>
            <CAccordionButton collapsed={activeKey !== 1} onClick={() => activeKey === 1 ? setActiveKey(0) : setActiveKey(1)}>
              Accordion Item #1
            </CAccordionButton>
          </CAccordionHeader>
          <CAccordionCollapse visible={activeKey === 1}>
            <CAccordionBody>
              <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default,
              until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
              element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and
              hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding
              our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within
              the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
            </CAccordionBody>
          </CAccordionCollapse>
        </CAccordionItem>
        <CAccordionItem>
          <CAccordionHeader>
            <CAccordionButton collapsed={activeKey !== 2} onClick={() => activeKey === 2 ? setActiveKey(0) : setActiveKey(2)}>
              Accordion Item #2
            </CAccordionButton>
          </CAccordionHeader>
          <CAccordionCollapse visible={activeKey === 2}>
            <CAccordionBody>
              <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default,
              until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
              element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and
              hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding
              our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within
              the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
            </CAccordionBody>
          </CAccordionCollapse>
        </CAccordionItem>
        <CAccordionItem>
          <CAccordionHeader>
            <CAccordionButton collapsed={activeKey !== 3} onClick={() => activeKey === 3 ? setActiveKey(0) : setActiveKey(3)}>
              Accordion Item #3
            </CAccordionButton>
          </CAccordionHeader>
          <CAccordionCollapse visible={activeKey === 3}>
            <CAccordionBody>
              <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default,
              until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
              element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and
              hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding

            </CAccordionBody>
          </CAccordionCollapse>
        </CAccordionItem>
      </CAccordion>
    )
  }}
</Playground>

### Flush

Add `flush` to remove the default `background-color`, some borders, and some rounded corners to render accordions edge-to-edge with their parent container.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [activeKey, setActiveKey] = useState(0)
    return (
      <CAccordion flush>
        <CAccordionItem>
          <CAccordionHeader>
            <CAccordionButton collapsed={activeKey !== 1} onClick={() => activeKey === 1 ? setActiveKey(0) : setActiveKey(1)}>
              Accordion Item #1
            </CAccordionButton>
          </CAccordionHeader>
          <CAccordionCollapse visible={activeKey === 1}>
            <CAccordionBody>
              <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default,
              until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
              element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and

            </CAccordionBody>

        </CAccordionItem>

          <CAccordionHeader>
            <CAccordionButton collapsed={activeKey !== 2} onClick={() => activeKey === 2 ? setActiveKey(0) : setActiveKey(2)}>
              Accordion Item #2
            </CAccordionButton>
          </CAccordionHeader>
          <CAccordionCollapse visible={activeKey === 2}>
            <CAccordionBody>
              <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default,

          </CAccordionHeader>
          <CAccordionCollapse visible={activeKey === 3}>
